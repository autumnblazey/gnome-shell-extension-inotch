# FAQ

## WTF? Why you create such an ugly extension?

Please ask Apple why they create such an ugly notch on their laptop.

**my response**: If you actually have used MacBook Pro with the notch, you will know that this isn't the case.

## I don't think this is funny and I think Apple already gives us the best solutionâ€¦

I might agree with those Apple fans if I never seen the new Dell XPS 15.

**my response**: addressed by the next "F"AQ... sort of

## XPS 15's camera is smaller, but Apple cares users' image qualityâ€¦

Then I have a more Apple-ish way: I'd like to sell an accessory called **iCamera**, which could be connected to your laptop with a USB-C adapter. You get a full monitor and the best image quality (compared with all built-in cameras), and Apple gets money (maybe I could get an offer from Apple too).

PS Before the release of new Macbook Pro, I was thinking about making a one-key external USB-C keyboard called **iEsc** and selling it to my friend who is suffering from Touchbar because of no Esc when using Vim.

It's silly? But who removed 3.5mm headphone jack and gives you a Lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter? (Firstly they said removing 3.5mm jack is to place bigger Haptics Engine for 3D Touch, but in 2021 we all know that **3D Touch is dead, as well as Touchbar**).

**my response**: Firstly, Apple would make accessories for their own devices using a native connection (USB-C or Thunderbolt 3/4 for their Macs), because common sense would say that they would want their own accessories to work well with their own devices. Apple cares about product quality and usability, if you've actually used one of their devices. Second, if your more "Apple-ish" way really is more "Apple-ish", then why hasn't Apple done it with this MacBook? Thirdly, the escape key has been on its way back since 2019. Also, I guarantee you 100% my escape key on my 2021 MacBook Pro is larger than yours. Weird flex, but hehe I like this escape key, it's a nice escape key. Fourthly, 3D Touch is gone, but Apple has been utilising that space for other things. I am not sure what specifically, but I would guess battery size or improvements to the speakers. Also, the headphone jack has never left the Mac, so I have no idea what the Touch Bar has to do with adding a haptic engine to the _iPhone_ for 3D Touch. Also, the Taptic Engine used in Apple's products feel soooo satisfying :p

## It covers my clock!

This is the same behavior as hardware notch. Don't ask Apple to do things for developers, but ask developers to do things for Apple! So write your own code to modify your software.

**my response**: If you actually have used MacBook Pro with the notch, you will know that this isn't the case. Also, Apple installed git for me, I think when I installed the XCode commandline tools (which are free by the way).

## My cursor disappears when it enters the notch!

This is the same behavior as hardware notch.

**my response**: I agree, it does hide behind the notch. However, if you actually have used MacBook Pro with the notch, you will know that this isn't as bad as some may make it seem. You can move it out much easier as it can come out 3 out of 4 sides, and there usually isn't anything there that you would bring your mouse towards anyways. The only thing that would be there are menu bar items, and you would know if it went in there because you moved your mouse in that direction. Why am I even overexplaining this

## It only shows on my primary monitor!

Yes, because no monitor manufacturer will add such a silly notch to their monitors, except Apple's internal monitor.

**my response**: For space reasons, no monitor manufacturer has _needed_ to add a notch to their monitors.

## Can this improve security?

Yes! There is no physical camera inside this extension, so it's even **safer** than the FaceTime 1080P HD camera which contains a physical camera that can be controlled by hackers!

**my response**: However, it lacks webcam and ambient light sensing capabilities. Also, your green light is always on, and that is incorrect for its functionality, as since the nonexistent camera is never recording, the light should always be off.

## Should I use this extension?

If you plan to betray free software and consecrate all your money to an evil system, yes.

**my response**: I have different views, and I will willingly "betray" free software because I just want to get shit done and want something that works well and consistently well. Also, heh your extension is free software isn't it? So you're saying that using free software "betrays" free software and fuels an "evil system"?

## This is not 100% the same as the Apple one!

If you love the Apple notch so much, you Apple fans just go to buy a real one!

**my response**: I love how people who love to hate on Apple attempt to use phrases like "Apple fanboy" or "Apple fans" to attempt to insult. Its not insulting to me. I am personally a fan of Apple's stuff because they make things that work and get the job done, and do so for a _very_ long time. I am 99% sure that this level of vertical integration gave this notebook much lesser points of failure, and as such will need less repairs to begin with, if that is what you are concerned about. Now if you'll excuse me, I will carry on enjoying my net screen increase from this notch that does not bother me in the slightest. Have fun!

## Your notch has a fixed size of 250x60, which is bigger than my whole screen!

Please ask Apple to make their camera smaller, I believe Apple will ask you to buy a bigger monitor in this case.

**my response**: correct response. I highly doubt Apple makes screens that small to begin with.

## Can I have option to...

Apple designed the notch to be the highest standard notch. You should be happy and satisfied with how it looks and behave. Since Apple doesn't give option to change the notch, you should not have the option to change the notch.

**my response**: ðŸ‘Œ

## This is a useless extension. Are you a useless developer?

No, I never do development on Apple platform, also check [Fixed IME List](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-fixed-ime-list/), [Always Show Workspace Thumbnails](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-always-show-workspace-thumbnails/) and [Net Speed](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-net-speed/) for my useful extensions.

**my response**: h, this is an extension for GNOME not macOS, so you are not developing for an Apple platform
